          <p>This is the home of Accessible Coffee.</p>
          <p>Not so many things here yet, but no worries, we are working hard on it. The new blog and other fancy stuff are coming out soon.</p>
          <p>Why don't you <a href=href="https://anchor.fm/accessiblecoffee"> go and listen</a> to some podcast while you're waiting? Okay, I know. The podcast section is a bit quiet, too.</p>
          <p class="shout">But!</p>
          <p>Officially the Accessible Coffee starts on September the 2nd, 2021.</p>
          <p>Please bookmark this page and come back soon; we're looking forward to having you here.</p>
